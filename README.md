# Unfinished project
# The project is comical and created with humor to reproduce my own and not only my, joyful moments in life associated with fishing. 
This project was developed and is still being developed primarily for testing my own knowledge. The project should have a variety of approaches, methods and ways of solving problems for my personal understanding. The variety of methods and approaches is my personal test and knowledge test to analyze my own behavior at the time of working with a project of this kind
